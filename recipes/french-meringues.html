		<h2>Descriptions</h2>
		<p>Authentic French Meringues from a patisserie in France.</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>4 egg whites</li>
			<li>2 ¼ cups confectioners' sugar </li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Butter and flour a baking sheet.</li>
			<li>In a glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until foamy using an electric mixer. Sprinkle in sugar a little at a time, while continuing to whip at medium speed. When the mixture becomes stiff and shiny like satin, stop mixing, and transfer the mixture to a large pastry bag. Pipe the meringue out onto the prepared baking sheet using a large round tip or star tip.</li>
			<li>Place the meringues in the oven and place a wooden spoon handle in the door to keep it from closing all the way. Bake for 3 hours, or until the meringues are dry, and can easily be removed from the pan. Allow cookies to cool completely before storing in an airtight container at room temperature.</li>
